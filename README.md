Weather Dashboard

This application gathers weather data for a city and displays said data in the browser. The user can search for weather data by entering a city in the search bar. After the search is submitted, weather data for the city is gathered and HTML elements are generated to display the elements on the web page. The search is then stored in local storage and added to a list uner the search bar, where the user can click to repeat previous searches.
